        <h1 class="#start">Getting Starting Guide</h1>

        <p class="lead">
            If you are reading this it means you are thinking of helping the Covid-19 fight with your 3D printer. That's awesome and we need all the help we can get.
        </p>

        <h5 id="a">Who's organizing all this?</h5>

        <p>
            Currently we are getting organized using the <a href="https://join.colors3d.com">BC Covid-19 3D Printing Slack channel</a>. There you can find the latest information on our efforts.
        </p>

        <h5 id="b">
            How can I help?
        </h5>

        <p>
            First you should sign up as a supplier using <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gvrd-face-shield-printers/home/headset-printers">this form</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Check the demand for the items <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gvrd-face-shield-printers/home/total-supply-and-demand">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Download the .stl files in the BC Covid-19 repository on <a href="https://github.com/bccovid-19/printfiles">Github</a>. Those are the files being used by our community.
        If you are a developer, join the #website channel on Slack.</p>

        <h5 id="c">
            Is there a specific item in high demand?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Both Visor Frames and Surgical Mask Strap are needed. You can check the current demand for the items <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gvrd-face-shield-printers/home/total-supply-and-demand">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h5 id="d">
            What 3D printers are required, known to work, or recommended?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Visor frames measure 159x184mm so printers must have plates large enough. Beyond this any FDM printer should work.
        </p>

        <h5 id="e">
            Am I required to print with a specific filament type?
        </h5>

        <p>
            For the Visor Frames, PETG is preferred but PLA is acceptable.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the Surgical Mask Strap, PLA is preferred, but PETG will also work. There are reports that TPU works great for them as well.
        </p>

        <h5 id="f">
            Are there any specific slicing configurations needed (layer height, printing speed, etc.)?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Please take some time to read <a href="https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/protective-visor-print-guide/">this guide</a>, since it has some good information that can even speed up the printing time.
        </p>

        <h5 id="g">
            What is the minimum quality expected of the prints? When should I discard or keep them?
        </h5>

        <p>
            If you have any concerns that your prints are not up to the minimum quality required, please use the #quality-control channel on our Slack. Post pictures of your prints and we will have people evaluating it.
        </p>

        <h5 id="h">
            We are printing the frames, what about the shields?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Currently there's a team there is responsible for adding the shields. As suppliers we should only have to worry about printing the frames and straps.
        </p>

        <h5 id="i">
            I have a few items printed, what now?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Delivery is likely to be handled by a local company, as will most pick-ups (more details expected by April 1st, 2020). We'll ask that each producer withhold the items they've printed for collection when there's a decent amount available, rather than a few at a time.
        </p>

        <h5 id="j">
            Where are my items going to be delivered to?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Currently the team is working to fulfill requests from local hospitals and nursing homes.
        </p>

        <h5 id="k">
            Am I supposed to sanitize my prints before handing it off?
        </h5>

        <p>
            It's difficult for us to identify the sanitizing needs of the recipients. On top of that we don't have any approved method of sterilization. For this reason we cannot ensure that the items are sterile.
        </p>

        <h5 id="l">
            I have a printer but no/running out of filament. How can I get more?
        </h5>

        <p>
            As mentioned by Gavin Dunne on our #filament-requests channel on Slack:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "With a generous donation from MG Chemical, we now have a supply of filament to share with our members. Please only pick up what you need, based on your production capacity for the next week! Remember to update your filament needs and other production figures after picking up. Please contact @Liam Shirley (on slack) or at 778-918-5042 to arrange pickup from the following address:
            <br><br>
            Caravan Stage Company<br>
            284 SW Marine Dr,<br>
            Vancouver, BC V5X 2R5<br>
        </blockquote>

        <h5 id="m">
            I can only print mask straps (a.k.a. Ear savers) but based on the numbers it looks like we have the production of those covered. Should I print it anyway?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Yes, We need as many as we can produce as we get more requests coming every day. In case we have more than what is needed we can distribute to other provinces/countries. So, Keep them coming.
        </p>
